NAME
    Finance::Card::Citibank - Check your Citigroup credit card accounts from
    Perl

SYNOPSIS
      use Finance::Card::Citibank;
      my @accounts = Finance::Card::Citibank->check_balance(
          username => "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
          password => "12345",
      );

      foreach (@accounts) {
          printf "%20s : %8s / %8s : USD %9.2f\n",
          $_->name, $_->sort_code, $_->account_no, $_->balance;
      }

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a rudimentary interface to Citigroup's credit card
    balances. You will need either "Crypt::SSLeay" or "IO::Socket::SSL"
    installed for HTTPS support to work. Version 2.01 was a re-write to use
    the OFX interface rather than screen scraping. This should make the
    module more stable as the screen scrapping method required updates
    whenever there were changes to Citigroup's site.

CLASS METHODS
  check_balance()
      check_balance( usename => $u, password => $p )

    Return an array of account objects, one for each of your bank accounts.

OBJECT METHODS
      $ac->name
      $ac->sort_code
      $ac->account_no

    Return the account name, sort code and the account number. The sort code
    is just the name in this case, but it has been included for consistency
    with other Finance::Bank::* modules.

      $ac->balance

    Return the account balance as a signed floating point value.

WARNING
    This warning is verbatim from Simon Cozens' "Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB",
    and certainly applies to this module as well.

    This is code for online banking, and that means your money, and that
    means BE CAREFUL. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit the source
    of this module yourself to reassure yourself that I am not doing
    anything untoward with your banking data. This software is useful to me,
    but is provided under NO GUARANTEE, explicit or implied.

THANKS
    Simon Cozens for "Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB". The interface to this
    module, some code and the pod were all taken from Simon's module.

    Brandon Fosdick's for his Finance::OFX module. I was unable to use the
    modules outright as their is quite a bit that differs between bank and
    credit card OFX, but some of his parsing routines were very helpful.

    Jon Keller added the ability to pull multiple accounts.
