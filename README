NAME
    Finance::Card::Citibank - Check your Citigroup credit card accounts from
    Perl

SYNOPSIS
      use Finance::Card::Citibank;
      my @accounts = Finance::Card::Citibank->check_balance(
          username => "xxxxxxxxxxxx",
          password => "12345",
      );

      foreach (@accounts) {
          printf "%20s : %8s / %8s : USD %9.2f\n",
          $_->name, $_->sort_code, $_->account_no, $_->balance;
      }
  
DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a rudimentary interface to Citigroup online at
    `https://www.citibank.com/us/cards/index.jsp'. You will need either
    `Crypt::SSLeay' or `IO::Socket::SSL' installed for HTTPS support to
    work. `WWW::Mechanize' is required. =head1 CLASS METHODS

  check_balance()

      check_balance( usename => $u, password => $p )

    Return an array of account objects, one for each of your bank accounts.

OBJECT METHODS
      $ac->name
      $ac->sort_code
      $ac->account_no

    Return the account name, sort code and the account number. The sort code
    is just the name in this case, but it has been included for consistency
    with other Finance::Bank::* modules.

      $ac->balance

    Return the account balance as a signed floating point value.

WARNING
    This warning is verbatim from Simon Cozens' `Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB',
    and certainly applies to this module as well.

    This is code for online banking, and that means your money, and that
    means BE CAREFUL. You are encouraged, nay, expected, to audit the source
    of this module yourself to reassure yourself that I am not doing
    anything untoward with your banking data. This software is useful to me,
    but is provided under NO GUARANTEE, explicit or implied.

THANKS
    Simon Cozens for `Finance::Bank::LloydsTSB'. The interface to this
    module, some code and the pod were all taken from Simon's module.

    Jon Keller added the ability to pull multiple accounts.
